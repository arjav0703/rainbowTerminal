## tauri-terminal

This little project shows how to make a terminal emulator in [Tauri](https://tauri.app/), using [`xterm.js`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/xterm) and [`portable-pty`](https://crates.io/crates/portable-pty).

> Note: You will need Jetbrains Mono installed unless you edit the code and pick the font yourself :)  

Don't hesitate to contribute! I think it could be faster.
